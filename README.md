Project Overview:

As a consultant for the New York City Tourism Board, our objective is to analyze the Airbnb market across the five boroughs of NYC. The board is particularly interested in gaining insights into key factors such as pricing trends, neighborhood popularity, and types of accommodations available. The ultimate goal is to identify tourist-attractive areas and develop an interactive dashboard to visualize these insights.

This project aims to support the tourism board in making data-driven decisions for promoting specific neighborhoods and Airbnb listing types to attract more visitors.

To perform this analysis, the New York City Airbnb Open Data dataset from Kaggle was selected as the primary data source.
